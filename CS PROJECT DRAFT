**CS2 PROJECT DRAFT**

*TITLE:*

•PSHS Public Announcement System• 

*PROBLEM STATEMENT:*

The current announcement system at PSHS-EVC at times causes inconvenience and 
confusion. Students have to stay in the gym for long periods of time, and the Student 
Alliance (SA) sometimes struggles to track which announcements are actually 
happening. While the EVC Direct Facebook page exists, it doesn’t serve too well in
organized official announcements. To solve this, the proponents, propose creating a 
clean and reliable website that collects confirmed announcements from all Academic 
Learning Programs (ALP), organizations, and student bodies. This system aims to 
make announcements clearer, faster to access, and easier to manage.

The website will be made using Python, a programming language used to create 
software and websites, and Streamlit, a tool for making simple web browser apps 
using Python, installed through pip, which is a program that helps add tools such as 
Streamlit itself. It may use a database like MySQL which can be used to store 
announcement details like title, content, date, and author, though that is subject to 
change. Announcements will automatically be removed after their set date. Posting 
access will depend on user roles—administrators can manage all posts, club or 
organization officers can post in their groups, and students can only view. The goal of 
this project is to make a centralized, secure, and easy-to-use announcement system 
that saves time and prevents confusion.
